# Source of example and code
The code is writtend by Jianqiao Zhu and Hao Zhong, contributed by Xiao Ge.

The code was built for data analysis in this paper: 

Ge, X., Leifer, L., & Shui, L. (2021). Situated emotion and its constructive role in collaborative design: A mixed-method study of experienced designers. Design Studies, 75, 101020. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142694X21000314 

The example input data is from the above paper.

**Please cite if you were to use the code.

# How to use the code:
Simply change the csv file with the time-series data you want to visualize and animate; And then run this file in your terminal: run_vocal_pitch.sh to 
The current example visualize a time-changing vocal pitch variable.

You can also adjust the chart type accordingly.
